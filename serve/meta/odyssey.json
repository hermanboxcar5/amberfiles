    "description":"The Odyssey by Homer, translated by Emily Wilson. \n\n In this, the first English translation of The Odyssey by a woman, Emily Wilson relays what has been described as “the first great adventure story in the Western canon.” Homer’s The Odyssey is a poem that explores the ramifications of war and violence, the intricacies of marriage and family, and the magnetism of wealth and power through one hero’s journey and subsequent search for home. Wilson’s translation, which matches the number of lines in the Greek original, conveys this stirring tale of shipwrecks, monsters, and magic in iambic pentameter verse while proving accessible for contemporary audiences. It is a major poetic accomplishment in its own right."
